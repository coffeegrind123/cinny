/**
 * Makes a dialog that is component state rather than a route dismissible with
 * the system Back gesture / button.
 *
 * On Android the WebView never sees a "back button" event: `MainActivity`
 * enables wry's back handling, so Back — including the left-edge swipe, which
 * in gesture-nav mode the system consumes before any touch reaches the page —
 * turns into `webView.goBack()`, i.e. a plain history pop. A dialog that isn't
 * a history entry therefore cannot be dismissed by it: Back navigates the route
 * *underneath* the dialog instead, and the dialog stays put looking like the
 * gesture did nothing.
 *
 * The fix is to give it an entry to pop. While mounted this pushes one
 * same-URL sentinel entry; popping it is what calls `onBack`. Because the URL
 * never changes, the router sees a POP to the location it is already on and
 * re-renders identically — nothing navigates.
 *
 * Same mechanism covers the desktop/browser Back button and mouse back
 * buttons, so the behaviour is one thing everywhere rather than an Android
 * special case.
 *
 * Mount the hook only while the dialog is open (these dialogs are already
 * rendered conditionally).
 *
 * @param onBack Invoked when our sentinel is popped. Runs off a ref, so it may
 *   close over changing state without re-pushing the entry on every render.
