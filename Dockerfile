# (or `curl` the registry manifest and read the Docker-Content-Digest header).

# Same rebrand publish-webapp.yml applies. Without it this image builds
# straight from source and ships as "Cinny": the script is the only thing
# that renames the title, manifest and UI strings, and nothing else in the
# repo calls it. Safe here because the checkout is throwaway -- it rewrites
# files in place, which is why it is NOT wired into `npm run build`.

# Run nginx unprivileged (UID/GID 101 = the `nginx` user that ships in the
# image). That requires three things beyond the USER line:
#   * a listen port above 1024 — docker-nginx.conf listens on 8080;
#   * a pid file the user can write — /var/run is root-owned, so move it to
#     /tmp and drop the `user` directive (only meaningful for a root master);
#   * writable temp/cache dirs — nginx buffers request bodies, proxying and
#     fastcgi responses under /var/cache/nginx.
